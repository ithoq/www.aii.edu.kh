It is an opportunity to establish expectations, set the tone, and to get to know students. When the students come to the first class, they are eager to know what will be taught in the course, what the instructor will be like, what will be required of them, and how they will be evaluated. In addition to providing detailed logistical information, begin the term by getting students involved. By planning a focused and dynamic ¬orientation, teachers will give students a better sense of the course overall.

                                    <li>What does Aii ESL classes offered?
                                        <p style="text-align: justify">Classes offer practice in the four main language skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The classes are divided into levels for beginners, low intermediate, high intermediate and advanced levels. </p>

                                    <li>My friend wants to take classes, but she doesn’t know any English. Does she really have to take the test?
                                        <p style="text-align: justify"> Yes. We do need to have every student make an attempt to take our test. It’s perfectly fine if someone can’t answer any of the questions—we have a class for students who are total beginners. The test is just one of many new things that a student will try in this program. </p>

                                    <li>What should I do if I'm late/my child is for school?
                                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                                            After being absent a written explanation is required when the child returns. We consider regular attendance to be most important, but please keep your child at home if s/he is sick. If there is a need for your child to be collected from school during school hours, parents must sign a partial absence note located at the Student’s Affairs Office, before collecting your child.
                                        </p>
