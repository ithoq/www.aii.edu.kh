                                This placement test is the writing test which students will be tested for vocabulary knowledge, grammar, and reading skills. The test lasts 60 minutes long. It is designed to give students a quick way of assessing the approximate level of a student's knowledge. The purpose of a placement test is to determine how much students know and how well they know it. There is no "passing" or "failing" on a placement test. A placement test serves only to "place" students in appropriate levels. It does not attempt to judge how "smart" or "dumb" they are; it does not try to grade their knowledge and it does not attempt to say how much they can accomplish in the future; it only judges, based on the experience of those writing the test, which class would best serve their educational needs right now.
