                                The Pre-Kid Program is a carefully designed program that slowly eases kids into the academic world. Bearing in mind that this stage of their life serves as a vital foundation and the continuous developmental growth of the kids, the program allows students the room to evolve through a purpose driven curriculum that encompasses practical life lessons and sensorial experiences which in turn helps foster language development.
