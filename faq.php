                            <li>What does Aii ESL classes offered?
                                <p style="text-align: justify">Classes offer practice in the four main language skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The classes are divided into levels for beginners, low intermediate, high intermediate and advanced levels. </p>

                            <li>My friend wants to take classes, but she doesn’t know any English. Does she really have to take the test?
                                <p style="text-align: justify"> Yes. We do need to have every student make an attempt to take our test. It’s perfectly fine if someone can’t answer any of the questions—we have a class for students who are total beginners. The test is just one of many new things that a student will try in this program. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>What should I do if I'm late/my child is for school?
                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                    After being absent a written explanation is required when the child returns. We consider regular attendance to be most important, but please keep your child at home if s/he is sick. If there is a need for your child to be collected from school during school hours, parents must sign a partial absence note located at the Student’s Affairs Office, before collecting your child.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Do I need to do anything if my child is late for school?
                                <p style="text-align: justify">On occasions where a late arrival is unavoidable, students are required to have a late note from the Student’s Affairs Office before going to class. </p>

                            <li>Can I take my child away from school before his/her class ends?
                                <p style="text-align: justify">f a child is leaving the school before 4:30pm they must complete a partial absence note at the Student’s Affairs Office.

                                    This is a legal requirement to protect your child. A note is required for all absences whether part or whole day. </p>
