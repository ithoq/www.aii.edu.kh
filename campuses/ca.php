                                            Engaging students to play Scrabble enhances their ability to recognize words. Such that they have actually been changing the process of reading words and they start to build spelling, vocabulary, and social skills. It can also give students a chance to compete against other students and they are learning without realizing it.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>BOOKMARKER</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Dig out students’ latent knowledge of creativeness by making them work independently. Creating art provides a distraction, giving your brain a break from your usual thoughts.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>BINGO</h3>
                                        <p>Let students have fun with words. Students are usually given a list of important words from the reading material and asked to discuss their meanings and relationship to the story. A fun and simple way to review these words and their meanings with your child is to play a kind of reverse bingo that features definitions as bingo cues. It’s an easy twist on the classic game and it will prepare your child for the vocabulary challenges.</p>

                                        <h3>SCAVENGER HUNT</h3>
                                        <p>Turn a group/individual activity into a learning experience. Let the students do the Scavenger Hunt and explore the unexplored books/things that can be found inside the library. Use word problems or simple math equations for clues to help children determine where to go next or how many steps to take as they search for the objects given.</p>

                                        <h3>STORYTELLING</h3>
                                        <p>We are promoting English speaking environment by letting the student to tell the story that they have just read. Storytelling is a unique way for students to develop an understanding, respect and appreciation for other cultures, and can promote a positive attitude to people from different lands, races and religions.</p>
